</I>&gt;<i> &gt; module, like the hpsb_packet in RT-FW. That way, RTnet can still keep
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the same naming for all rtskb functions. See below how currently rtpkb
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is defined:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; struct rtpkb {
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        /*meta stuff for general memory management*/
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;          ......

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         char          specific_stuff[256]; /*rtskb specific stuff goes here*/
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; };
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Would like to know your opinion:)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I checked the situation in more details again. This is how I see at ATM:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  o rt-buffers as RT-FireWire and RTnet use consist of a single memory
</I>&gt;<i>    fragment, starting with a buffer head, followed by a payload buffer.
</I>&gt;<i>    RTnet requires almost 1700 bytes per buffer, RT-FireWire more than
</I>&gt;<i>    4k. But RTnet may require more in case we ever start using jumbo
</I>&gt;<i>    frames for gigabit Ethernet (i.e. &gt;8k).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  o In order to make buffer fully exchangeable between RT-FireWire and
</I>&gt;<i>    RTnet, both subsystems must agree on
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     1. a common rt-buffer size
</I>&gt;<i>     2. a minimum buffer head size to let every user put some private
</I>&gt;<i>        data into the header as well
</I>&gt;<i>     3. the same kernel slab pool to take additional buffers from
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>What I understand about the buffer header is: it is composed of the
meta stuff, which is used both for general memory management (like
payload size, the pool where the buffer belongs to, etc) and for
application-specific management (like the Ethernet frame headers), and
the pointer to the payload memory. A rt-buffer struct pointer can be
safely casted to an pointer to application-specific buffer struct, and
vice versa.

&gt;<i>    The third item actually enforces the first one - but may
</I>&gt;<i>    unfortunately do this in the wrong direction, i.e. provide too small
</I>&gt;<i>    buffers for one instance.
</I>&gt;<i>    Requirement 3 could be avoided by using kmalloc instead of
</I>&gt;<i>    kmem_cache_alloc for each individual buffer, but this may easily
</I>&gt;<i>    increase the overhead due to not optimally sized memory fragments.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes, I agree.

&gt;<i>  o As we should not simply set the worst-case size as default for all,
</I>&gt;<i>    some flexibility at least during compile time is required regarding
</I>&gt;<i>    the size parameters (1. and 2.). More precisely, that subsystem which
</I>&gt;<i>    is closer to the physical media dictates the rt-packet size.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I also agree that the size of buffer should be flexible. It could be
an argument that is specified to the pool allocating API in the
general memory management(say RTDM).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now let's think about some approaches to fulfill these requirements in a
</I>&gt;<i> generic, maybe also extensible way:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  o The rt-buffer pooling mechanism is a generic feature probably suited
</I>&gt;<i>    for more scenarios than RTnet and RT-FireWire. I'm currently playing
</I>&gt;<i>    with the idea to move the functionality into the RTDM layer. The core
</I>&gt;<i>    features would be:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Good idea. In RT-FireWire, the general memory management has been
separated from application-specific buffer management: we have rtpkb
(for general) and hpsb_packet (for FireWire protocol). But, to move
the functionality to a base layer, like RTDM, seems more reasonable.

&gt;<i>     - Providing non-real-time allocation for rt-buffers from -what I
</I>&gt;<i>       would call it- parent pools. Buffers from parent pools can be
</I>&gt;<i>       organised in local real-time pools by the drivers and, in case
</I>&gt;<i>       they come from the same parent pool, freely exchanged.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     - Parent pools need to be identified by a unique name. The first
</I>&gt;<i>       user which accesses a parent pool under a yet unregistered name
</I>&gt;<i>       will create that pool with rt-buffer size that it provides with
</I>&gt;<i>       the request.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     - Any additional user of an existing parent pool specifying a
</I>&gt;<i>       different rt-buffer size will receive an error. Thus we make sure
</I>&gt;<i>       that all users cleanly agree on the same size beforehand. By
</I>&gt;<i>       &quot;size&quot;, I also mean the minimum header size, i.e. actually two
</I>&gt;<i>       parameters.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Above 3 seem fine to  me.
&gt;<i>     - Moreover, one can discuss which features from RT-FireWire's rtpk
</I>&gt;<i>       and RTnet's rtskb implementation should make it into RTDM. I
</I>&gt;<i>       haven't thought about this yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
rtpkb has some functions that rtskb does not have. We can take a look
into these details later.

&gt;<i>  o Applying this new RTDM feature to the RTnet/RT-FireWire situation, we
</I>&gt;<i>    would first have to establish some mechanism to agree on rt-buffer
</I>&gt;<i>    sizes. As RTnet with its rt_eth1394 driver is stacked on top of
</I>&gt;<i>    RT-FireWire and its buffers are (currently) smaller, it will simply
</I>&gt;<i>    grab RT-FireWire's parameters from some exported header during
</I>&gt;<i>    compile time. Then RTnet can call RTDM to either join or create the
</I>&gt;<i>    fitting parent pool.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>The pool allocating API of RTDM can be called either when the pool (of
which the name is specified as argument) has been allocated or not. If
allocated, the API simply returns the existing pointer to the pool.

&gt;<i>  o Due to the significant overhead of using 4k buffers for standard
</I>&gt;<i>    Ethernet and the possibility that RTnet may support jumbo frames in
</I>&gt;<i>    the future, a scheme for using different parent pools, thus rt-buffer
</I>&gt;<i>    sizes for different network devices has to be established in RTnet
</I>&gt;<i>    later on. But this requires some refactoring and API extensions and
</I>&gt;<i>    is nothing for a quick shot.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Ok, again, the buffer size can be set as argument. But for now, I
think we only need to focus on the service-provider part, i.e. RTDM.

Now, I have some further idea: what if we also bind the packet
capturing service with the memory management. That is if a real-time
application needs real-time memory allocation, it can also ask for
capturing of all those allocated memory (packets). We can use some
user-space tools to analyze the captured memory. The captured memory
can be delivered via fake Ethernet interface, so tools like Ethereal
can be used (only need to extend it based on the application).

The capturng of a packet can be done when that packet memory is freed,
where the capturing operation is transparent to the application. Well,
the application must claim somewhere  before the packet is freed that
it should be captured, e.g. right after it is allocated.

Concerning the packet capturing idea, we can explore more, if it is
agreed to be interesting and effort-worth.

Comments wanted, questions welcome:)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Dear list,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; please consider this to answer using less jargon. I'm still in Users'
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; side, not in Developers'  yet :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. After loading Xenomai+RT-FW+ RTnet + rt_eth1394 modules I found the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; firewire card as &quot;rteth1&quot; using rtifconfig (also assigned an IP to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it). Now,  If I attach a camera or any other ieee1394 capable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; firewire node in that card's any port, in that case how   can I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; communicate with that node  under RTnet ? Does that node also have the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; same  IP?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With another ieee1394 capable PC, you can build a fake Ethernet
</I>&gt;<i> connection between 2 PCs, both holding different IP. But you /cannot/
</I>&gt;<i> use rt_eth1394 to communicate with a 1394 camera. The communication
</I>&gt;<i> over rt_eth1394 only happens via asynchronous transaction. As I know,
</I>&gt;<i> 1394 camera only supports isochronous streaming on one or more
</I>&gt;<i> channels, which means your PC has to listen to that isochronous
</I>&gt;<i> channel in order to receive the video signal. Unfortunately, the
</I>&gt;<i> real-time video module in RT-FW has not yet been implemented / ported
</I>&gt;<i> from Linux.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If yes, then if I use rt_dev_socket calls from user space code then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what would be the parameters like AF_PACKET, SOCK_DGRAM etc. ? (I'm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; looking on RTnet's raw-packets.c and other example files)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. From rt_eth1394 module, as per my understanding, I saw if  2 PC
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have rt_eth1394 loaded then they can communicate (without any user
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interaction!). But If I want to send packet to a node that don't have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rt_eth1394 module (in the same bus/ FW card's any port)  then I need
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to change the module. Could you please give me some hints?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> NO, in principle it is not suggested.
</I>&gt;<i> Let's see how high-level applications over FireWire work first.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A high-level application, being rt_eth1394 or others, claims to
</I>&gt;<i> reserve a certain range of the low-level 48-bit address space on the
</I>&gt;<i> local node.
</I>
One remark: here we only talk about asynchronous transaction-based
application, like rt_eth1394. If you use isochronous transaction, like
video streaming, then what I said here does not apply. But then:

the application claims to reserve a certain channel for sending or
receiving or both. In FireWire bus, there is isochronous resource
management that is handled by a node called isochronous manager (All
PC-based 1394 nodes are capable of this job). Any node who wants to
reserve a new channel (and bandwidth) or give up a channel should
(according to 1394spec) send a message to iso manager to let him
update the new channel usage. In case of reserving a channel or
bandwidth, the iso manager may say /NO/ if that channel has been
occupied by someone. The communication with iso manager is actually
read, write or lock operation on the two CSR registers of iso manager
node: the iso channel register and bus bandwidth register.

Go back to RT-FW, the communication with iso manager is not implicitly
done by the protocol stack. That is if a new application will be
developed to use the iso transaction on FireWire, it must itself agree
on the initial procedure and try to communicate with the iso manager.
For the iso manager, see the output of hostconfig: the one with extra
bus channel and bandwidth display is the iso manager.

Hope this piece of text can help. But if somehow you got confused,
dont hesitate to tell me:)

Later on, all the communication of that applicatoin only
&gt;<i> happen in that range of address. In RT-FW, the address range of a
</I>&gt;<i> certain applicaion is fixed on all nodes, and that is used to
</I>&gt;<i> construct the FW frame header in the lower FireWire protocol stack.
</I>&gt;<i> That means if you customize your own application which occupies the
</I>&gt;<i> same address range (or at least with some overlap) with rt_eth1394's,
</I>&gt;<i> you can use rt_eth1394 on one node to send packets to the customized
</I>&gt;<i> application on another node. But, I dont see the point of doing this.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe you can explain to me more about your intention?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As I've checked the classic/ non-RT  ieee1394 driver's  eth1394 files
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and found some functions have been exported to user space to use by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; applications. In this case is it possible to do the same?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Which functions do you mean? Could you point them out explicitly here?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3. For the sake of simplicity, can we start adopting raw1394's async
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; part first and do iso later. you may ask me to do something by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pointing out the major tasks in a specific manner.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. I am going to sketch the code frame of rt_raw1394 module.
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully within 2-3 days, we can start dicussion here and see how to
</I>&gt;<i> allcoate the task:)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm again would like give you thanks and  appreciate for your attention.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As you know that, to make something so-called user friendly it's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sometimes obvious to face some unfriendly talks :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> The final destination of us is to make RT-FW competitive and user friendly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Btw, a good book for learning FireWire: &lt;&lt;FireWire System
</I>&gt;<i> Architecture, 2nd Edition&gt;&gt; by Anderson.D.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Keep in touch.

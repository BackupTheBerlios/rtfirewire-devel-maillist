</I>&gt;<i> 1. After loading Xenomai+RT-FW+ RTnet + rt_eth1394 modules I found the

</I>
With another ieee1394 capable PC, you can build a fake Ethernet
connection between 2 PCs, both holding different IP. But you /cannot/
use rt_eth1394 to communicate with a 1394 camera. The communication
over rt_eth1394 only happens via asynchronous transaction. As I know,
1394 camera only supports isochronous streaming on one or more
channels, which means your PC has to listen to that isochronous
channel in order to receive the video signal. Unfortunately, the
real-time video module in RT-FW has not yet been implemented / ported
from Linux.

&gt;<i> If yes, then if I use rt_dev_socket calls from user space code then
</I>&gt;<i> what would be the parameters like AF_PACKET, SOCK_DGRAM etc. ? (I'm
</I>&gt;<i> looking on RTnet's raw-packets.c and other example files)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. From rt_eth1394 module, as per my understanding, I saw if  2 PC
</I>&gt;<i> have rt_eth1394 loaded then they can communicate (without any user
</I>&gt;<i> interaction!). But If I want to send packet to a node that don't have
</I>&gt;<i> rt_eth1394 module (in the same bus/ FW card's any port)  then I need
</I>&gt;<i> to change the module. Could you please give me some hints?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>NO, in principle it is not suggested.
Let's see how high-level applications over FireWire work first.

A high-level application, being rt_eth1394 or others, claims to
reserve a certain range of the low-level 48-bit address space on the
local node. Later on, all the communication of that applicatoin only
happen in that range of address. In RT-FW, the address range of a
certain applicaion is fixed on all nodes, and that is used to
construct the FW frame header in the lower FireWire protocol stack. 
That means if you customize your own application which occupies the
same address range (or at least with some overlap) with rt_eth1394's,
you can use rt_eth1394 on one node to send packets to the customized
application on another node. But, I dont see the point of doing this.
Maybe you can explain to me more about your intention?

&gt;<i> As I've checked the classic/ non-RT  ieee1394 driver's  eth1394 files
</I>&gt;<i> and found some functions have been exported to user space to use by
</I>&gt;<i> applications. In this case is it possible to do the same?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Which functions do you mean? Could you point them out explicitly here?

&gt;<i> 3. For the sake of simplicity, can we start adopting raw1394's async
</I>&gt;<i> part first and do iso later. you may ask me to do something by
</I>&gt;<i> pointing out the major tasks in a specific manner.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes. I am going to sketch the code frame of rt_raw1394 module.
Hopefully within 2-3 days, we can start dicussion here and see how to
allcoate the task:)

&gt;<i> I'm again would like give you thanks and  appreciate for your attention.
</I>&gt;<i> As you know that, to make something so-called user friendly it's
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes obvious to face some unfriendly talks :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>The final destination of us is to make RT-FW competitive and user friendly.

Btw, a good book for learning FireWire: &lt;&lt;FireWire System
Architecture, 2nd Edition&gt;&gt; by Anderson.D.

Keep in touch.

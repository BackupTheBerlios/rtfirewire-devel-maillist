</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Here I am again:)

Today, I just checked in the first framecode of rtraw1394 in
/trunk/highlevel/rtraw1394. Not too much code, but the basic things
are there, I think.

Let's start from the communication between kernel-side protocol stack
and user-side application. In NRT Linux1394, it is thru /dev/raw1394.
Now,in RT-FW, we need to rebuild this on RTDM. Conceptually they are
quite similiar. Plus, we have another good reference, i.e. the
real-time serial driver using RTDM (distributed with Xenomai).

The 'rtraw1394&quot; (dev in RTDM) will be like a char device in Linux, so
we need to implement rt_raw1394_read and rt_raw1394_write. The basic
concept in raw1394 can be moved here, i.e. writing and reading
&quot;pending_request&quot; struct to the &quot;rtraw1394&quot;. What I know now is we
have to redesign and implement the synchronization scheme between user
application and rtraw1394 module in kernel. For example, when the
application on raw1394 try to poll &quot;/dev/raw1394&quot;, the waiting_queue
sync scheme is used if no completed request is pending, but if we also
implement the poll operation here, we have to figure out another sync
scheme which is real-time safe.  Another issue is mmap, but for now I
dont know if we need it and how we can do it in real-time,
specifically on RTDM.

It will be nice if we can fully understand the functionalities of
raw1394 first. But since now we only focus on asynchronous
transactions, the isochronous operations can be temporarily skipped:
ioctl and rawiso_XXX.

Basically, an application has two means to use asynchronous service of
RT-FW: Address Range Mapping (ARM) and Functional Control
Protocol(FCP). ARM is to let application reserve a certain range of
the logical space on FW, so any packets sent to that range of address
will be re-directed to the application. FCP actually is two registers
in the CSR range of address: FCP-request and FCP-response. Everytime a
packet is sent to either of these two, CSR module will forward it to
the high-level modules who has claimed to be interested in messages
coming thru FCP, in this case, raw1394 will be notified. Then, it will
further forward the packet to user applications who are listening to
the FCP &quot;channel&quot;. Again, all kernel-user communications here are NOT
directly coupled: the kernel raw1394 module only generate a
&quot;pending_request&quot; and pend it to the queue, where the applications
will read.

Next step is to fill in the framecode with more flesh code. The
raw1394 works like a state machine, which we can further take a look
and reuse for our design. Comments are welcome here, but also good if
directly committed to the code (either comments or code).

P.S. Tomorrow, I am going to take flight back to China for the xmas
and new jaar holiday. I am gonna travel in a city for 3 days before I
can go back to my hometown, which means I will not access Internet in
next 3 days. But feel free to send mail when your
remarks/ideas/questions are fresh:).

Best regards,
Yuchen

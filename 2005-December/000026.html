<PRE>Dear list,

please consider this to answer using less jargon. I'm still in Users'
side, not in Developers'  yet :)

1. After loading Xenomai+RT-FW+ RTnet + rt_eth1394 modules I found the
firewire card as &quot;rteth1&quot; using rtifconfig (also assigned an IP to
it). Now,  If I attach a camera or any other ieee1394 capable 
firewire node in that card's any port, in that case how   can I
communicate with that node  under RTnet ? Does that node also have the
same  IP?
If yes, then if I use rt_dev_socket calls from user space code then
what would be the parameters like AF_PACKET, SOCK_DGRAM etc. ? (I'm
looking on RTnet's raw-packets.c and other example files)

2. From rt_eth1394 module, as per my understanding, I saw if  2 PC
have rt_eth1394 loaded then they can communicate (without any user
interaction!). But If I want to send packet to a node that don't have
rt_eth1394 module (in the same bus/ FW card's any port)  then I need
to change the module. Could you please give me some hints?

As I've checked the classic/ non-RT  ieee1394 driver's  eth1394 files
and found some functions have been exported to user space to use by
applications. In this case is it possible to do the same?

3. For the sake of simplicity, can we start adopting raw1394's async
part first and do iso later. you may ask me to do something by
pointing out the major tasks in a specific manner.

I'm again would like give you thanks and  appreciate for your attention.
As you know that, to make something so-called user friendly it's
sometimes obvious to face some unfriendly talks :)


Best Regards,

Faruque

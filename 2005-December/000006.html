<PRE>Hi all,

good chance to post my first mail to this list. :)

Nice to hear that there is another contributor for this important project!

What about Xenomai 2.1 support? Already planned for the near future? I'm
asking as I recently reworked RTnet's build system for the new build
model (in-kernel) of upcoming 2.1. But the eth1396 driver would not work
yet, of course.

At this chance, I also re-enabled kernel 2.4 support for RTnet. Xenomai
works for x86 and PPC also over the &quot;old&quot; kernel now, and RTnet compiles
against 2.4.31-adeos again (no clue if it runs as well, I didn't test
it). I don't know how much of your code depends on 2.6 kernel features,
but maybe it's worth checking how much work the build system would
require for this. But: low priority, 2.4 support foremost targets
low-end and existing systems where FireWire is not that often found.

For all changes that where required, see RTnet SVN for details - or ask
me. Also, feel free to bother me with any RTDM questions and quirks when
defining and implementing raw1394 for that layer.

Good luck for your future work!
Jan

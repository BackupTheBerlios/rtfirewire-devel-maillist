<PRE>Dear Yuchen,

It's very nice that in spite of your busy schedule you replied me. I
never mind if it's fast or late, coz, i'm  enjoying very much to
discover and uncover  this new field and also I'm prepared to go a
long way :)

As a part of my discovery, I've tried to make a layered structure of
RT-FW current modules using modinfo. I found something like this
(please fix me if I'm wrong):


                      bis1394                     *User App* (talks
with /dev/rt_raw1394)
                          |                               |
                 --------------                       |
                 |                |                      |
                 |          [rt_ohci1394]     *RT_RAW1394*
                 |                |                      |
                 |                |     ----------------
                 |                |     |
                 |             [rt_ieee1394]
                 |                      |
                 |        ------------------------
             (rtpc)   |                             |
                 |       |                             |
             (rt_serv)                            |
                 |                                    |
              ----------                           |
              |           |                          |
&lt;xeno_rtdm&gt; &lt;xeno_native&gt;    |
         |                 |                      |
&lt;&lt;xeno_nucleus&gt;&gt;                 (rt_pkbuff)
             |                                        |
             |           ------------------------
             |          |
 &lt;&lt;&lt;xeno_hal&gt;&gt;&gt;

Please Note:
a) My art may not be so good, Anyway I noticed that modinfo is saying
that rt_ohci1394 is dependent on ieee1394 (Non-RT)! is this mistake or
anything else?

  b) In the libraw1394 document
(<A HREF="http://www.linux1394.org/doc/overview.php">http://www.linux1394.org/doc/overview.php</A>) it is said that ohci1394
is lower level driver with respect to ieee1394, but modinfo says that
ohci1394 is dependent on ieee1394. what is your explanation regarding
RT-FW?

c) I placed our desired *RT_RAW1394* above  rt_ieee1394.  I think, raw
module can directly talk with rt_ieee1394 and also will use exported
symbols/functions from rt_ieee1394 . Is this ok?

d) Is this case do we need a user library like  libraw1394 or
alternately, /dev/rt_raw1394 (with some IOCTLs) is sufficient for now?

I'm actually thinking for &quot;at least async capable&quot; rt_raw interface.
Could you please start discussion about that and also indicate what
kind of RT capability we have to put inside that rt_raw1394  module?

Soon I hope to repeat RT-FW testing on P-IV Intel motherboard with
ipipe patch + a minimum change in Kernel and Xenomai Configuration. 
BTW, one person asked me the pronunciation of &quot;Xenomai&quot;. Is this
&quot;jeno-mayee&quot; or &quot;eno-mai&quot; or ... :)

Have a nice  time !

Best Reagrds,

Faruque

</I>
To make RTnet compile against 2.1, I only had to work on the build
system, no code changes. The core is issue is that Xeno 2.1 no longer
has some xeno-config for the kernel build. You directly have to build
against the Xeno-extended kernel - and derive all required information
from that tree beforehand. So, you also have to ask the user again for
the linux path while this was previously derivable from the Xeno
installation.

If you do not build any userspace tools against Xeno libs, you no longer
need to query the installation dir on the other hand. RTnet only asks
for it now when you switch on the examples, i.e. also userspace Xenomai
programs.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>At this chance, I also re-enabled kernel 2.4 support for RTnet. Xenomai
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>works for x86 and PPC also over the &quot;old&quot; kernel now, and RTnet compiles
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>against 2.4.31-adeos again (no clue if it runs as well, I didn't test
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>it). I don't know how much of your code depends on 2.6 kernel features,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>but maybe it's worth checking how much work the build system would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>require for this. But: low priority, 2.4 support foremost targets
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>low-end and existing systems where FireWire is not that often found.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This could be scheduled for next release of rtfw. Basically, we should

</I>&gt;<i> then see if there is a voice for 2.4 support.  Anyway, upgrade always

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
As I said: low prio. RTnet was more or less prepared for this due to its
history (we were 2.4 only until autumn 2004). I haven't checked your
files, but maybe RT-FireWire would need both work on every makefile and
potential changes to the source code (where the kernel API is different).

But let's see first how more 2.4 users will re-assemble around Xenomai.
At least the low-end PPC community seems to be strongly interested.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>For all changes that where required, see RTnet SVN for details - or ask
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>me. Also, feel free to bother me with any RTDM questions and quirks when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>defining and implementing raw1394 for that layer.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I guess Faruque will bother you more often:)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Good luck for your future work!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks!

<PRE>Dear Yuchen,

Thanks 4 info about CSR module. But may be I'm still lagging behind
from your hints. As I'm new to this type of job please fix me.

I've tried  to compile the csr module by replacing obj-m line in
Makefile of build/stack folder with this:

obj-m +=csr.o

and it compiles with some warning and after that when i tried to
insert it and got error about missing symbol about
&quot;high_level_fcp_request&quot; again I tried to build module highlevel.ko
and similarly got error from insmod for the missing of the following
symbols:

ioctl_handlers
hpsb_hosts_lock
hpsb_hosts
hpsb_update_config_rom_image

I just did this without knowing inner details. As I need to show some
demo of RT-FW   at my lab so I need a roadmap for sending read/write
request to any ieee1394 capbale node.
so please fix me about my planned steps to write a simple user space
app using csr.ko:

1. loading all current rt-fw modules including this csr.ko (after fixing) ??
2. define struct csr_control and hpsb_host, hpsb_packet ...??
3. call  add_host() read_maps() read_regs() etc to fill up the struct members ??
4.  then use some packet sending functions ???
5. Read the CSR registers for status ??
6. And Where to find the content of the returned packet??

Anyway I hope to study ieee1394commander tool  soon and also off
course I must make some (one stop painless) HOWTOs and Docs on RT-FW
for new users :)

At this moment I'm remembering my past experience on 1999 when I saw
no helpful Linux book was written in my native language. I was crazy
enough to wrote a book for  beginning Linux and indeed it was a best
seller at that time!

Currently I got less time to document anything rather testing new
things all the time!

My lab is working for both RT Control and Vision and Now I'm involved
in control part and hope to work on RT-FW for a long time. I've 2-3
PCs with ieee1394 cards and CCD Cameras and   soon I hope to get some
ieee1394 enable DSPs. Actually I don't know much about DSPs. Then what
other lab stuff may be  required in future?

Anyway I look forward to seeing better days with rt- fw based control.

Thanks and best regards,


Faruque

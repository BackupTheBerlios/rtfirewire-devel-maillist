<PRE>Hi Yuchen,

time to kick this discussion again ;) - no I didn't forget it!

Ok, sounds interesting. But I guess this does not yet mean that there
can be multiple capturers for the same packet? I guess it means that you
decide later during the stack traversal (or earlier when looking at the
transmission path) if you want to grab a certain packet or not. Some
kind of in-kernel capturing filter instead of doing this later with
Ethereal&amp;friends?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But all in all, the new Capturing is oriented to application instead
</I>&gt;<i> of network interface:
</I>&gt;<i> when rtcap module in RTnet is loaded, it changes the xmit_hook&amp;rx_hook

</I>&gt;<i> am wrong:)) The new Capturing is new mainly because it lets
</I>&gt;<i> applications take over the control of capturing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Mmh, doesn't this confuse the user and make the management of all those
potential capturing sources a bit complicated? I already had problems to
explain users why there is also a &quot;rteth0-mac&quot; that additionally records
the queuing date of packets deferred by a RTmac discipline. Actually, I
haven't stumbled over a useful use case for this feature on my own so far...

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>struct rt-buffer{
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>          .....
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>          struct Cap_struct *aCap;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>}
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>And this link is needed as there can be multiple capturers, right? But
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>what about the additional fields required by rtcap to save the initial
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>buffer layout, the compensation buffer, timestamp, and other stuff? Note
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>that rtcap does deferred capturing. Does your service in RT-FireWire
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>work the same way?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My idea was also deferred capturing, but somehow it was not clearly expressed:)
</I>&gt;<i> And yes, the timestamp will be in rt-buffer struct also. For
</I>&gt;<i> compensation buffer, my initial idea was to only capture the rt-buffer
</I>&gt;<i> when it is being freed. In that case, we dont need the compesation
</I>&gt;<i> buffer pointer in rt-buffer struct, since the compensation buffer will
</I>&gt;<i> be immediately given to the application buffer pool, i.e. buffer
</I>&gt;<i> exchange between application and capturer. That's also why the
</I>
I think to remember having created such a variant in the early rtcap
days. It works well beside one &quot;minor&quot; ugliness: the queuing order in
the rtcap pseudo device became chaotic due to deferred buffer release of
certain NICs and other effects. This means that you will also see a
non-chronological list in Ethereal! Ok, one may try to reorder the
packets in rtcap before forwarding it, but this adds further complexity
and delay (you first have to collect for a while, then reorder, and
finally forward the packets).

&gt;<i> cap_rtbuffer function should return the pointer to compensation
</I>&gt;<i> buffer. BUT now, I would rather choose to let application decide when
</I>&gt;<i> to capture the packet: stamping the time, assigning the compensation
</I>&gt;<i> packet and putting into the queue of captured packet. That is more
</I>&gt;<i> similiar to rtcap in RTnet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So the rt-buffer struct will be
</I>&gt;<i> struct rt-buffer{
</I>&gt;<i>        ..........
</I>&gt;<i>        struct Cap_struct *aCap;
</I>&gt;<i>        struct rt-buffer *comp_buf;
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>/*function to create a Cap_struct*/
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>struct Cap_struct *create_cap( int size, //  the buffer size
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>                                             struct kernel_slab_pool
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>*parent_pool,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>                                              char *name) // the name
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>of fake ethernet dev, should be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>//specific about application
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>{
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       if(*name already exists){
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>               return (address of existing Cap_struct)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       }
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>      .............
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>}
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>/*function to remove a Cap_struct*/
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>void remove_cap(struct Cap_struct *aCap_struct)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Ok, this makes sense.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>/*function to capture a buffer*/
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>struct rt-buffer *cap_rtbuffer(struct rt-buffer *abuffer, int
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>buffer_size, struct cap_struct *aCap)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>{
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     if(aCap-&gt;buffer_size != buffer_size)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>                   //print error msg and return
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     else{
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>          //allocate a compesating buffer from the cap pool
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>          // exchange buffers
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>          //deliver the captured buffer to fake ethernet dev
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I hope you do NOT deliver immediately, just pend the delivery for Linux
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>to get in the CPU again.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I thought this would not be real-time killing, since the main work is

</I>
Yep, this is fine if it's just that non-RT signal.

[mail #2]

&gt;<i> Sorry, I sent the last mail by mistake, it has not been finished. So
</I>&gt;<i> the story continues here:)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The changed cap_rtbuffer is like:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   void cap_rtbuffer(struct rt-buffer *abuffer, int
</I>&gt;<i>   buffer_size, struct cap_struct *aCap)
</I>&gt;<i>  {
</I>&gt;<i>           if(aCap-&gt;buffer_size != buffer_size)
</I>&gt;<i>                    //print error msg and return

</I>&gt;<i>                    //allocate a compensating buffer from the cap pool
</I>&gt;<i>                   if(failed)
</I>&gt;<i>                         //out of memory failure and return
</I>&gt;<i>                   //assign comp buffer to abuffer
</I>&gt;<i>                  // stamp the time
</I>&gt;<i>                  //put the buffer to the queue as captured packet
</I>&gt;<i>          }
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
In terms of rtcap: would cat_rtbuffer be something like
rtcap_report_incoming and would it be called from the xmit-hook for
outgoing packets?

But we will certainly still have something like rtcap_mark_incoming to
save the real packet dimension, don't we?

&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;<i> Em...I would like to know more about this: how to move the capturing
</I>&gt;<i> mark in RTnet from where it is now? Now, I see it only happens when
</I>&gt;<i> packets is transmitted or received.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Well, the decision about capturing a packet or not is made for incoming
packets via rtmac_report_incoming. For outgoing ones, we have the hook
before the drivers transmission routing, a low intrusive approach
regarding code modification. To move to incoming capturing point would
be simple, but we would need a similar functions then also for outgoing
packets to gain more flexibility.

But this just raises the question for we what subsystems / packet
producer you want to instrument separately in this way? And how will the
user select the right one? Will there be bulks of pseudo network devices
for capturing?

&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;<i> I just created a new branch in RTFW svn. Now only copied the files
</I>&gt;<i> from RTFW's rtpkbuff module, but can be compiled separately. A
</I>&gt;<i> starting point.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
That's a good step forward! Actually, I think we should keep all this
capturing discussion in min, but first start off with the &quot;real&quot; work.
RTnet's rtskbs and RT-FireWire's rtpks also began without capturing, so
we should also be able to easily extend the first common (and maybe
working) concept with this feature later.

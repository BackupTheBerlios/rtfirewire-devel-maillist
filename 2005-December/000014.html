<PRE>Hi Jan,

&gt;<i> &gt; I am just going to annouse the 0.1 release of rt-fw. After that, I would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like to discuss about the short-term developement in the rt-fw mailing list.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Basically, it would be the user-interface, like raw1394, and complete the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; packet captureing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What about Xenomai 2.1 support? Already planned for the near future? I'm
</I>&gt;<i> asking as I recently reworked RTnet's build system for the new build
</I>&gt;<i> model (in-kernel) of upcoming 2.1. But the eth1396 driver would not work
</I>&gt;<i> yet, of course.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Why eth1394 does not compile? What is the problem? Or first, I should
ask what you changed on the original RTnet code? Especially what
changes went to the drivers?

&gt;<i> At this chance, I also re-enabled kernel 2.4 support for RTnet. Xenomai
</I>&gt;<i> works for x86 and PPC also over the &quot;old&quot; kernel now, and RTnet compiles
</I>&gt;<i> against 2.4.31-adeos again (no clue if it runs as well, I didn't test
</I>&gt;<i> it). I don't know how much of your code depends on 2.6 kernel features,
</I>&gt;<i> but maybe it's worth checking how much work the build system would
</I>&gt;<i> require for this. But: low priority, 2.4 support foremost targets
</I>&gt;<i> low-end and existing systems where FireWire is not that often found.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>This could be scheduled for next release of rtfw. Basically, we should
let potential fw users in the community to try current rt-fw first,
then see if there is a voice for 2.4 support.  Anyway, upgrade always
has higher priority than backgrade:)

&gt;<i> For all changes that where required, see RTnet SVN for details - or ask
</I>&gt;<i> me. Also, feel free to bother me with any RTDM questions and quirks when
</I>&gt;<i> defining and implementing raw1394 for that layer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I guess Faruque will bother you more often:)

&gt;<i> Good luck for your future work!
</I>Thanks!


Yuchen

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Would like to know your opinion:)

I checked the situation in more details again. This is how I see at ATM:

 o rt-buffers as RT-FireWire and RTnet use consist of a single memory
   fragment, starting with a buffer head, followed by a payload buffer.
   RTnet requires almost 1700 bytes per buffer, RT-FireWire more than
   4k. But RTnet may require more in case we ever start using jumbo
   frames for gigabit Ethernet (i.e. &gt;8k).

 o In order to make buffer fully exchangeable between RT-FireWire and
   RTnet, both subsystems must agree on

    1. a common rt-buffer size
    2. a minimum buffer head size to let every user put some private
       data into the header as well
    3. the same kernel slab pool to take additional buffers from

   The third item actually enforces the first one - but may
   unfortunately do this in the wrong direction, i.e. provide too small
   buffers for one instance.
   Requirement 3 could be avoided by using kmalloc instead of
   kmem_cache_alloc for each individual buffer, but this may easily
   increase the overhead due to not optimally sized memory fragments.

 o As we should not simply set the worst-case size as default for all,
   some flexibility at least during compile time is required regarding
   the size parameters (1. and 2.). More precisely, that subsystem which
   is closer to the physical media dictates the rt-packet size.


Now let's think about some approaches to fulfill these requirements in a
generic, maybe also extensible way:

 o The rt-buffer pooling mechanism is a generic feature probably suited
   for more scenarios than RTnet and RT-FireWire. I'm currently playing
   with the idea to move the functionality into the RTDM layer. The core
   features would be:

    - Providing non-real-time allocation for rt-buffers from -what I
      would call it- parent pools. Buffers from parent pools can be
      organised in local real-time pools by the drivers and, in case
      they come from the same parent pool, freely exchanged.

    - Parent pools need to be identified by a unique name. The first
      user which accesses a parent pool under a yet unregistered name
      will create that pool with rt-buffer size that it provides with
      the request.

    - Any additional user of an existing parent pool specifying a
      different rt-buffer size will receive an error. Thus we make sure
      that all users cleanly agree on the same size beforehand. By
      &quot;size&quot;, I also mean the minimum header size, i.e. actually two
      parameters.

    - Moreover, one can discuss which features from RT-FireWire's rtpk
      and RTnet's rtskb implementation should make it into RTDM. I
      haven't thought about this yet.

 o Applying this new RTDM feature to the RTnet/RT-FireWire situation, we
   would first have to establish some mechanism to agree on rt-buffer
   sizes. As RTnet with its rt_eth1394 driver is stacked on top of
   RT-FireWire and its buffers are (currently) smaller, it will simply
   grab RT-FireWire's parameters from some exported header during
   compile time. Then RTnet can call RTDM to either join or create the
   fitting parent pool.

 o Due to the significant overhead of using 4k buffers for standard
   Ethernet and the possibility that RTnet may support jumbo frames in
   the future, a scheme for using different parent pools, thus rt-buffer
   sizes for different network devices has to be established in RTnet
   later on. But this requires some refactoring and API extensions and
   is nothing for a quick shot.

So far my ideas. Comments are welcome, questions as well. I hope the
actual implementation is not half as long as this posting. ;)

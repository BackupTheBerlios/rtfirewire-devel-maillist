<PRE>Dear Faruque,


&gt;<i> Thanks a lot for your warm reply. I'm very glad to join with rt-firewire
</I>&gt;<i> team.
</I>&gt;<i> we hope to make the rt firewire user friendly and useful soon.
</I>

I am just going to annouse the 0.1 release of rt-fw. After that, I would
like to discuss about the short-term developement in the rt-fw mailing list.
Basically, it would be the user-interface, like raw1394, and complete the
packet captureing.

[ CAUTION: please don't be hurry to reply or even read completely to
&gt;<i> this mail now! coz' its' a very long story  :) ]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, i assume u have some time to read this mail, so let's have a
</I>&gt;<i> look to address a generic user Mr. X's wish to talk with the firewire
</I>&gt;<i> card C's 1st port's resident Mr. R (An OHCI compliant ieee1394 generic
</I>&gt;<i> node ).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Case-1: PHY/Async Quadlet Read
</I>&gt;<i> --------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> User X :  Hey Mr. R, Can you give me your NodeNumber ( first 6 bit
</I>&gt;<i> from your OHCI NodeID Register located at Offset E8h) ?
</I>&gt;<i> Node R: I got your request .please wait
</I>&gt;<i> Node R: Here's the  quadlet, please check it.
</I>&gt;<i> User X: Ok, Thanks.
</I>

the csr module is taking care of the access to all the base registers. See
the csr.c file. Basically, the csr module is no more than a module in the
application layer: registered to take care of a certain range of address (in
the 48-bit 1394 address).

Case-2: PHY/Async Write
&gt;<i> ------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> User X: Hey R, can you write this busNumber to your busNumber Register
</I>&gt;<i> (6-15 bit of NodeID Register) ?
</I>&gt;<i> Node R: I got your request .please wait
</I>&gt;<i> Node R: I complete your request, here's what i already wrote.
</I>&gt;<i> User X: Ok, Thanks.
</I>
the same, csr is taking care of this.


Both cases are more or less similar (pls fix me if i am wrong). So as
&gt;<i> the rt-firewire developer how we can staisfy the demands ?
</I>

there is a  non real-time command tool called 1394commander developed on
Linux 1394 subsystem, exactly for the same purpose, i.e. accessing the base
registers. But, it is based on raw1394. On current implementation of rt-fw,
we either have to make a kernel module specifically to deal with the access
to base registers, so on the user side, we only need to give some IOCTL
command via, say /dev/rt-firewrie, OR we make rt_raw1394 to allow fully
access to the whole address space from user space, which of course includes
the base registers.

As per my imagination the path of request/response flow is like this:
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> User  X
</I>&gt;<i> 1----&gt; rt-fw-client (User Space app)
</I>&gt;<i> 2----&gt; rt-fw-server (process) or (rt_raw1394 and bis module using
</I>&gt;<i> /dev/rt-firewire interfacing with rtdm)
</I>&gt;<i> 3---&gt; rtdm ( upon posix/native skin of xeno_nucleus with xeno_hal)
</I>&gt;<i> 4----&gt; rt_ohci1394 and rt_ieee1394 (using xenomai rtos api modules
</I>&gt;<i> rtpc, rt_serv, rtpkbuff )
</I>&gt;<i> 5----&gt; (hardware) ieee1394 Card C's 1st Port :
</I>&gt;<i> Node R.
</I>

Basically, you are right.

For now, I'm very much curious how you sent async/iso packets to
&gt;<i> client and measure the time statistics  (as mentioned in your MSc
</I>&gt;<i> Report) from user space ?
</I>

For asyn packets, I measured the roundtrip latency just using the rtping.
For iso packets, I used another program to measure the data arrival interval
drift on the packet receiving side, since the iso transmission is only
1-way. This is a bit tricky.


1. with the current codes, is there any way to write some user space
&gt;<i> app to talk with /dev/rt-firewire for the above purpose? As I checked
</I>&gt;<i> the source files i got a few ioctl() calling options are available,
</I>&gt;<i> like IOC_RTFW_* PING, ISO_START, ISO_SHUTDOWN and some other BUS
</I>&gt;<i> MANAGEMENT options(ohci_devctl) in rt_ohci1394 and some other old
</I>&gt;<i> ioctl() options in ieee1394-ioctl.h file. Specifically how can I write
</I>&gt;<i> a user space app to send/recv some requests to/from the running
</I>&gt;<i> rt-firewire driver?
</I>

As you can also conclude from what I said above, it is currently not
implemented to let user-space program get full direct access to the 1394
address space. In the non real-time Linux 1394 world, this access is (again)
fully based on raw1394. Currently, we only can use eth1394 to get access to
FireWire like to Ethernet, but the access range is only limited to the space
registered by the eth1394 driver.

2. Could you please suggest some good references for learning about
&gt;<i> how to write code of user space app to interact with  running kernel
</I>&gt;<i> device driver ? I've already studied LDD, LKM Prog. Guide and
</I>&gt;<i> Beginning Linux Prog.(from wrox) etc. But I'm in a complete dark
</I>&gt;<i> position to interact with the rt-fw drivers except rtping / hostconfig
</I>&gt;<i> (though i managed to read the 2kB OHCI registers by writing user space
</I>&gt;<i> code using mmap call)
</I>

Em......the best one in my mind is Linux Device Driver 3rd edition, which
probably you have read:)

3. BTW, is the  bis module support to add a new node ? if I attach a
&gt;<i> ieee1394 Camera how can I add this node and do a rtping to it?
</I>

Nope. Bis module can only talk to another PC-based 1394 node, which must
have loaded bis module also.

I hope to go through the Xenomai and RTDM soon and then i would like
&gt;<i> to uncover Linux raw1394,the existing black box, to get something like
</I>&gt;<i> that in rt_* domain.
</I>&gt;<i> what you think?
</I>

For me, it is good:). If I may ask, are you going to work on this like for
your MSc project? Do you have some real lab stuff to do some testing? I am
not giving you any pressure, but I am just curious to know:)

Again I would like to give thanks for reading all my boring talks.


Haha, I like this kind of discussion very much. You are always welcome to
ask questions, even some really boring one:)

Wishing you happiness 4 all the time


Thanks, the same 2 you.

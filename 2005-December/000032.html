<PRE>Sorry, I sent the last mail by mistake, it has not been finished. So
the story continues here:)

The changed cap_rtbuffer is like:

  void cap_rtbuffer(struct rt-buffer *abuffer, int
  buffer_size, struct cap_struct *aCap)
 {
          if(aCap-&gt;buffer_size != buffer_size)
                   //print error msg and return
          else{
                   //allocate a compensating buffer from the cap pool
                  if(failed)
                        //out of memory failure and return
                  //assign comp buffer to abuffer
                 // stamp the time
                 //put the buffer to the queue as captured packet
         }
}


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt;At least for RTnet, capturing is a debugging feature you don't what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt;compiled in for production systems. It adds overhead to some critical
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt;paths that may hurt on low-end boxes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I dont think the overhead is noticable. When the base module (say
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; RTDM) has capturing option enabled, the only overhead that happens to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; applications that do NOT need capturing   is, in the free_rtbuffer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; function, the extra checking of a rt-buffer's cap_struct pointer.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well, the current kfree_rtskb in RTnet has to do more. It iterates over
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all rtskbs in a (possible) chain and checks for each if it is a captured
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; one. Anyway, this needless overhead in the capturing-compiled-in-but-
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not-used case can be avoided with a simple check before entering any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; loop. So, you are likely right, the overhead is acceptable - and could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; still be reduced when we add a CONFIG_switch to RTDM.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Apropos chains: does RT-FireWire's rtpk support them? If we drag
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; capturing into the core service layer, this is required.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>Yes, chaining will be supported also. Not yet in current RT-FireWire's
rtpkb module, but will be a new feature.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt;The question to me is then what functionality of the capturing subsystem
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt;could be moved to RTDM while still keeping the control of using it or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt;not (without runtime costs) at the configuration level of the driver
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt;using it. I would like to be able to switch capturing off during &quot;make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt;menuconfig&quot; of RTnet, but maybe switching it on for RT-FireWire at the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt;same time.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The capturing I am proposing is conceptually different from the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; capturing in RTnet (what I understood). It is fully oriented to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; applications, while RTnet's capturing is more or less per networking
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; interface. That means in this new capturing service, buffer capturing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; can happen /anywhere/, even something totally away from network
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; transaction. This is especially useful when we develop multiple
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; applications over /one/ FireWire interface: we may only want to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; capture buffers used by one high-level application. Besides FireWire
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I may not know my own code well enough, but I don't see a reason why
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; setting the capturing mark in RTnet should not be movable, also away
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from the general places where it is right now.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>Em...I would like to know more about this: how to move the capturing
mark in RTnet from where it is now? Now, I see it only happens when
packets is transmitted or received.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and Ethernet, other applications based on RTDM, like socketCAN, can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; also benefit from this service, as long as they need some analysis
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; over the used memory to gain some insight to the system behavior.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I had Socket-CAN in mind as well first, but Sebastian's implementation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is smartly not using discrete CAN-packet buffers. Rather, there are ring
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; buffers per receiving socket. This is more efficient than throwing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; around 8 bytes data + some bytes head per CAN frame in individual
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; packets. CAN packets are too small to justify the maintenance costs of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; skb-like approaches - that's at least my strong believe (but we should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; soon be able to do some benchmarks on this as well - there is a Linux
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; skb-based variant on the way).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Anyway, one may consider if &quot;external&quot; users of the rt-packet capturing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; services make sense as well. But that's more kind of a second or third step.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; BTW, are you going to work on these soon, at least the memory
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; management part? How can I contribute? My idea is to make RTDM
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My plan was to burden much of the development on you, as my time is more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; than just limited. ;)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well, I have no fixed schedule, but I guess things will move quickly as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; soon as we have some API and data structures.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; temporarily a separate module that can be compiled over xenomai, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; put it either on RTnet svn or RT-FireWire svn.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I wouldn't drag the whole RTDM module back in RTnet again (that's too
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; platform dependent anyway). I would suggest to develop the required
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; services as an optional subsystem first inside RT-FireWire and RTnet. As
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; soon as this API is stable for each individual project, we could than
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; merge it into a private Xenomai tree, test the cooperation between RTnet
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and RT-FireWire, and then start submitting patches against Xenomai first
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and RTAI later.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And, with the RTDM-packet subsystem still in both projects available, we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could continue to provide support for older RTDM cores without that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; feature. Detecting the RTDM API revision is easy and could be used to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decide if the internal rt-packet code should be build.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>I just created a new branch in RTFW svn. Now only copied the files
from RTFW's rtpkbuff module, but can be compiled separately. A
starting point.

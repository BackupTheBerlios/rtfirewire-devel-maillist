<PRE>Hi Jan,

Best Greetings!
Nice to write you 4 the first time.

Referring to my RT-FW-0.1 installation process,  If I try to insert
rt_serv.ko without loading xeno_native.ko it misses &quot;rt_timer_start&quot;
symbol.

I also compiled the RTnet on the same PC but at first I failed to
compile rt_eth1394 because of rt-fw header file missing. then I copied
all rt-fw include/*.h into RTnet's drivers/eth1394/ folder. then it
compiled without error. Is there anything unlinked?

Could you please add some generic hints about the  TDMA settings in
rtnet.conf. In most cases I expect PnP settings or some easy
instruction from the developer. coz at first setup I feel to be a lazy
user to read all your readme doc :)

If I have two linux box (one RT and another NRT)  connected directly
(NIC 2 NIC)then what  should be my typical TDMA settings? Hopefully
after a big test I may be able to report the rtnet's result also.

Now have a brief about my study (as I saw some &quot;??&quot; in your reply)

Well, I've just enrolled myself in this MS course last September'05. 
My BSc was in Mechanical Engineering. So right now, no high-level
algorithms at all! You're exactly right about my plan to use RT-FW in
Robotics Project.

Currently I'm associated with Intelligent Robotics Research Center at
Korea Institute of Science and Technology(KIST, not KAIST). Sounds
very amazing! Haha, I'm a foreign student (they call us &quot;Alien&quot;) and
upto now a good observer!

Actually from my undergraduate I'm using Linux (Since Red Hat 6.x) and
also did some job as Sys Admin. So I love the freedom and power of
computing in Linux. And now trying to discover RT domain. It's already
a lot I have told you, isn't it :)

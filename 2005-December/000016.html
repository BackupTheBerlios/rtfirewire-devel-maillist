<PRE>Dear Faruque,

&gt;<i> I've tried  to compile the csr module by replacing obj-m line in
</I>&gt;<i> Makefile of build/stack folder with this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> obj-m +=csr.o
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and it compiles with some warning and after that when i tried to
</I>&gt;<i> insert it and got error about missing symbol about
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;high_level_fcp_request&quot; again I tried to build module highlevel.ko
</I>&gt;<i> and similarly got error from insmod for the missing of the following
</I>&gt;<i> symbols:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ioctl_handlers
</I>&gt;<i> hpsb_hosts_lock
</I>&gt;<i> hpsb_hosts
</I>&gt;<i> hpsb_update_config_rom_image
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Em...I dont get the point why you wanna make csr and highlevel as
separate modules.
Anyway, since all these files are using some symbols from other files,
if you wanna load them separately, you have to make sure other files
are loaded before, which will prevent the missing symbol problem as
you have seen.

&gt;<i> I just did this without knowing inner details. As I need to show some
</I>&gt;<i> demo of RT-FW   at my lab so I need a roadmap for sending read/write
</I>&gt;<i> request to any ieee1394 capbale node.
</I>&gt;<i> so please fix me about my planned steps to write a simple user space
</I>&gt;<i> app using csr.ko:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. loading all current rt-fw modules including this csr.ko (after fixing) ??
</I>&gt;<i> 2. define struct csr_control and hpsb_host, hpsb_packet ...??
</I>&gt;<i> 3. call  add_host() read_maps() read_regs() etc to fill up the struct members ??
</I>&gt;<i> 4.  then use some packet sending functions ???
</I>&gt;<i> 5. Read the CSR registers for status ??
</I>&gt;<i> 6. And Where to find the content of the returned packet??
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>To write a user space function to talk to rt-fw module (without
eth1394), you need to define a communication mechanism between kernel
and user space. If you look into the libraw1394 (user-space library to
access Linux raw1394), you can find: the communication is driven by
user-side, which polls the kernel side for any newly coming message,
either transaction message or other bus events (like bus reset). But I
believe we do have quite some other options (mailbox, fifo, etc),
which are more realtime, provided by Xenomai (also RTAI).

Anyway, if you wanna write some user-space program on rt-fw, the
current rt-fw cannot directly support that unless you use eth1394,
which means your program will be no different from socket programming.

BUT, the pressure to port raw1394 to rt-fw is obviously there, so we
need to take some action anyway. I guess you are also interested, so
let's start the work and keep on the discussion.

&gt;<i> Anyway I hope to study ieee1394commander tool  soon and also off
</I>&gt;<i> course I must make some (one stop painless) HOWTOs and Docs on RT-FW
</I>&gt;<i> for new users :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>it will be very nice if you can put these HOWTOs in the rtfw repos.
BTW, do you have account in berlios? If not, just create one and tell
me, so I can add you to the team to allow you write access to the
repos.

&gt;<i> At this moment I'm remembering my past experience on 1999 when I saw
</I>&gt;<i> no helpful Linux book was written in my native language. I was crazy
</I>&gt;<i> enough to wrote a book for  beginning Linux and indeed it was a best
</I>&gt;<i> seller at that time!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Currently I got less time to document anything rather testing new
</I>&gt;<i> things all the time!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My lab is working for both RT Control and Vision and Now I'm involved
</I>&gt;<i> in control part and hope to work on RT-FW for a long time.
</I>That's really great!

I've 2-3
&gt;<i> PCs with ieee1394 cards and CCD Cameras and   soon I hope to get some
</I>&gt;<i> ieee1394 enable DSPs. Actually I don't know much about DSPs. Then what
</I>&gt;<i> other lab stuff may be  required in future?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Em...do you already know which kind of DSP boards you will get? Just
drop me a weblink so I can also find them:) if/when you know. For
other stuff, I dont know, should depends on what you will do.

&gt;<i> Anyway I look forward to seeing better days with rt- fw based control.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Surely you will and keep in touch!

Best regards,
Yuchen

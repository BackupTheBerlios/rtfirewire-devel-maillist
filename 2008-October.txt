Subject: [Rtfirewire-devel] Data transfer over firewire
Message-ID: <ae699bf70810290637i6c3b6df4v1a283bd8f2e222da@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I want to transfer byte data between applications running on two
different PCs running Linux OS. I want to do it over Firewire. So i am
looking for a high level protocol over ieee1394 for connection
management and data transfer. The data is not image data but large
number of bytes (~500 KB every 50 ms). I don't want to use etherner
communication because i have witnessed some delay in data transfer
which causes problem in my application. Please suggest on this.

My PC runs linux kernel 2.6 with real time extensions.

Best Regards
Luvy Garg

In general you can use FireWIre. It is meant for this kind of bulk
data transfer. What kind of real time extension do you have for your
kernel?

BTW, what kind of delay do you see when using ethernet?

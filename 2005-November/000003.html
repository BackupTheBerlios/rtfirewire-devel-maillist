<PRE>Dear Yuchen,

Thanks a lot for your warm reply. I'm very glad to join with rt-firewire team.
we hope to make the rt firewire user friendly and useful soon.

[ CAUTION: please don't be hurry to reply or even read completely to
this mail now! coz' its' a very long story  :) ]

Well, i assume u have some time to read this mail, so let's have a
look to address a generic user Mr. X's wish to talk with the firewire
card C's 1st port's resident Mr. R (An OHCI compliant ieee1394 generic
node ).

Case-1: PHY/Async Quadlet Read
--------------------------------------------------
User X :  Hey Mr. R, Can you give me your NodeNumber ( first 6 bit
from your OHCI NodeID Register located at Offset E8h) ?
Node R: I got your request .please wait
Node R: Here's the  quadlet, please check it.
User X: Ok, Thanks.

Case-2: PHY/Async Write
------------------------------------
User X: Hey R, can you write this busNumber to your busNumber Register
(6-15 bit of NodeID Register) ?
Node R: I got your request .please wait
Node R: I complete your request, here's what i already wrote.
User X: Ok, Thanks.

Both cases are more or less similar (pls fix me if i am wrong). So as
the rt-firewire developer how we can staisfy the demands ?

As per my imagination the path of request/response flow is like this:

User  X
1----&gt; rt-fw-client (User Space app)
2----&gt; rt-fw-server (process) or (rt_raw1394 and bis module using
/dev/rt-firewire interfacing with rtdm)
3---&gt; rtdm ( upon posix/native skin of xeno_nucleus with xeno_hal)
4----&gt; rt_ohci1394 and rt_ieee1394 (using xenomai rtos api modules
rtpc, rt_serv, rtpkbuff )
5----&gt; (hardware) ieee1394 Card C's 1st Port :
Node R.

For now, I'm very much curious how you sent async/iso packets to
client and measure the time statistics  (as mentioned in your MSc
Report) from user space ?

1. with the current codes, is there any way to write some user space
app to talk with /dev/rt-firewire for the above purpose? As I checked
the source files i got a few ioctl() calling options are available,
like IOC_RTFW_* PING, ISO_START, ISO_SHUTDOWN and some other BUS
MANAGEMENT options(ohci_devctl) in rt_ohci1394 and some other old
ioctl() options in ieee1394-ioctl.h file. Specifically how can I write
a user space app to send/recv some requests to/from the running
rt-firewire driver?

2. Could you please suggest some good references for learning about
how to write code of user space app to interact with  running kernel
device driver ? I've already studied LDD, LKM Prog. Guide and
Beginning Linux Prog.(from wrox) etc. But I'm in a complete dark
position to interact with the rt-fw drivers except rtping / hostconfig
(though i managed to read the 2kB OHCI registers by writing user space
code using mmap call)

3. BTW, is the  bis module support to add a new node ? if I attach a
ieee1394 Camera how can I add this node and do a rtping to it?

I hope to go through the Xenomai and RTDM soon and then i would like
to uncover Linux raw1394,the existing black box, to get something like
that in rt_* domain.
what you think?

Again I would like to give thanks for reading all my boring talks.


Wishing you happiness 4 all the time

Best Regards,

Faruque

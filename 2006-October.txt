Hi all!

I have successfully installed rt-firewire over Xenomai 2.2. I started playing 
around a bit, but when I try to load the module bis1394, my system freezes. 
The critical call seems to be "hpsb_register_highlevel(&bis_highlevel);". Has 
anybody encountered this before? I could load all other modules without 
problems.

Bernhard.

Not being able to comment on what precisely may happen here, I would
suggest to try catching more information. Maybe there is an oops going
on you just cannot see anymore. Check

linux/Documentation/serial-console.txt or
linux/Documentation/networking/netconsole.txt

how to catch anything the kernel may spit out before going South.

If you want to dive deeper, this may be of some interest as well:

(just keep CONFIG_PREEMPT off for now, kgdb has a bug)

Hi,

sorry for the a bit late response.

Which version of RTFW are you using? I just tried the latest version
from https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/rtfirewire/trunk with Xenomai
2.2, and I can load bis1394 without any problem. But I got another
problem that rtping is not working any more:(. I dont have much time
thesedays to work on RTFW, but I think we'd better to make RTFW more
diagnosable, in order to more efficiently find a clue when things go
weird. Kgdb would be an option here. Another is to just add more
configurable message print-out in critical paths, such as
hpsb_register_highlevel.

Huh? If I use "modprobe" instead of "insmod", it works... But I'm sure I 
didn't forget any modules, "lsmod" lists exactly the same ones as before 
(except for bis1394 of course). That's weird...

Thanks for the debugging tips Jan, I've set up a serial console now, just in 
case.

Bernhard.

I think the reason for that is that modprobe uses insmod to first load 
any prerequisite modules into the kernel, and then the requested 
module.  Modprobe also knows the correct location of the prerequisite 
modules, which is important because it's possible to have more than one 
module called e.g. raw1394 on your machine.  This is one explanation i 
guess.

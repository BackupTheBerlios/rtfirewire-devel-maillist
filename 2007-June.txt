I think this is caused by the fact that for this xenomai version, no configuration menu is present. I tryed to change the auto configuration file, but I cannot open it. The next error occured: cannot open config/m4/libtool.m4 there is no such file or directory. I also couldn't configure RTAI 3.4, but after some modifications to the normal config file, I managed to get it working. For Xenomai however, this is a lot of work. How can I get this working?

I just tried again the trunk version on sourceforge, it compiles with
xenomai-2.1 and Linux 2.6.14. Also rtping works well. Be aware that
you need to specify the path to your real-time linux with
--with-linux, and the path to your xenomai's configure tool with
--with-rtext-config. See the README I just checked in -- in the top
folder not the Documentation folder.

after running the configure tool, the CONFIG_RTAI_30 or others will be
defined. rtos_primitive.h depends on these macros.

I read in another post, that another tool than rtping is used to test the latency for isochronous transaction. I would like to use that tool in order to have a clear reference wit the test results shown in the Msc report.

I didnt make a specific tool for the isochronous testing -- maybe i
expressed my wish to make such a tool. I did some workaround to make
isochronous transaction happen and measured the data arrival interval.

I followed youre instructions about the configuring, but now I get stuck at the RTDM skin. (see console output below)

checking for RT-extension... /usr/src/linux-2.6.15.7-Xenomai (kernel 2.6.15.7-xenomai2.1.3 + Xenomai)
checking for Xenomai installation dir... /usr/xenomai
checking for Xenomai DESTDIR... none
checking for Xenomai version... 2.1.3
checking for RTDM skin...   configure: error: *** Please enable RTDM skin

For xenomai 2.1 there is no menu config anymore, it is done automatically. 
In the compiled xenomai directory however, RTDM is present in the include directory. 
What am I doing wrong?

Greetings,

Harm

No need for this. RTFirewire is configured just like RTnet, except that
it just comes with plain configure. You need to pass
--with-linux=<path-to-xenomai-kernel>
--with-rtext-config=<path-to-xeno-config> for modern Xenomai versions.

Please, you or Yuchen: get rid of most of these primitives! We have RTDM
as clear abstraction (minus RTAI legacy stuff like rtos_timer_start --
but those are only _2_ functions). Use RTDM_API_VER to detect changes in
that API. Additionally, you can check for CONFIG_XENO_21x or
CONFIG_RTAI_3x to detect in what world you live. See RTnet
(stack/include/rtnet_sys*.h) for how tiny this abstraction can look like
today.

Please pick recent versions for this! Don't benchmark Xenomai 2.0 e.g.,
that's pointless for new projects. Also use a recent kernel, not 2.6.15.
The same applies to RTAI as well (older versions than 3.5 are broken
/wrt RTDM or unsupported anyway).

Can't help with the tool, but maybe with something else:

I've hacked (it is _really_ a quick-hack!) support for building
rtfirewire trunk against Xenomai trunk (RTDM rev. 6) and 2.6.20, see
attachment (it's huge and packed due to generated automake changes).
There were quite a few API violation popping up (namely around
rtdm_lock_t vs. spinlock_t), and there are still warnings. So, be warned
;), it may break.

For comprehensive testing, I can recommend latest I-pipe patches
(2.6.20-i386-1.8-04) with full debug options (CONFIG_IPIPE_DEBUG_CONTEXT
+ CONFIG_XENO_OPT_DEBUG_RTDM). This can help reveal broken pieces in the
stack due to refactoring (or even older problems).

The kernel config moved where it belongs: into the kernel. Check the
"Real-time sub-system" menu when configuring your kernel.

More details might be found in the config.log.

As can be seen, is RTDM included in the kernel. 

The part of the config.log (of the kernel cofiguration) where the RTDM option is shown:
#
# RTAI emulator unavailable, disable native API or build it as module
#
CONFIG_XENO_SKIN_RTDM=y
# CONFIG_XENO_SKIN_UVM is not set

Maybe I have to insert RTDM as a module to get it working..

Sorry, I was referring to the config.log you'll find in your rt-firewire
build directory. Mine locks like this in the interesting section:

That won't help, rt-firewire's configure already tests for both:

        # check for RTDM skin, needed by rt-firewire
        AC_MSG_CHECKING([for RTDM skin])
        case "${CONFIG_XENO_SKIN_RTDM}" in
            y | m) AC_MSG_RESULT([${CONFIG_XENO_SKIN_RTDM}]) ;;
            *) AC_MSG_ERROR([*** Please enable RTDM skin]) ;;
        esac

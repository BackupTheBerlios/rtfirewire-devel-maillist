Message-ID: <4B92C117.1050301@gmx.de>

Hello,

iam new on the mailinglist.

i've read that there is a know issue during loading the rt_serv module. 
Can anyone tell me some details about the problem ?
I would like to run rt-firewire under xenomai-2.4.3 with kernel 2.6.24 
and after loading rt_serv the systems freezes.

Hi Ralf ,
I too faced the same problem long back.
I have used xenomai-2.4.2 with rt-firewire.
It wont freeze if you are loading in the proper order.
Can you be more specific?
Can you post a screenshot of this?
What are the modules you have loaded succesfully
Have you loaded rtpkbuff
What is the version of rtnet you are using?

Regards,
Satya

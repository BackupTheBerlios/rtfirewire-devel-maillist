Dear Yuchen,

I've read your paper for the Realtime Linux Workshop later this week, but
from it, it isn't clear to me how one would use a firewire camera in
realtime mode. Is this possible, and how? Does one need to adapt the linux
firewire driver or not? How can one find out whether one's firewire camera
is realtime or not?

Best regards,

Herman

PS I lost the url to the realtime firewire mailinglist ... (Not the one on
Berlios, because that contains no messages at all :-)

Dear Herman,

nice to hear from you:)

FireWire camera itself is just a node in the FireWire network. Normally,
there is no software in the camera, which means from the physical layer to
application layer (digital video signal coding and sending) everything is
implemented in hardware. While on the other side, e.g. on Linux box with
FireWire interface, a specific driver (e.g. dv1394, video1394) is used to
dump the video data and decode it according to certain protocol. This driver
needs to be adapted in order to do real-time video signal processing. As to
the camera, I dont think we need to do anything in order to make it
"real-time", because, as I said, most of case it is just a piece of
hardware.

Actually, the adaption of Linux driver for FireWire camera is on the roadmap
of RT-FireWire, but due to the lack of hardware, also the limited time in my
MSc project, I havent started this task.

Indeed, the berlios mailing list is the only official mailing list of
RT-FireWire. But sadly enough, it is still almost empty, due to the fact
that RT-FireWire is still a start-up project, and I havent done any
advertising in the community. But, I have forwarded your message to the
mailing list, so from now on, all interesting discussions will/should be
archived.

Some words about myself:)
I finished my MSc project in the end of august. Now, I am employed as a
trainee in Technical University of Eindhoven, a 2-year program for Embedded
System Design, so called post-MSc. Although I am still deeply interested to
work on FireWire, I can only use my free time in the evening / weekends.
Even that depends on the task load in my job. Like today, I could not find
time earlier to reply you. Personally, I would be very happy if someone can
take over part of the FireWire work, e.g. the branch on real-time video. In
that case, I will try my best to deliver my current knowledge and offer
other support. Also, to develop things like real-time video, it is better to
have a complete setup (with some actuating device, instead of just a
camera), which is however impossible to put in my private room.

I am really interested to keep on the discussion about real-time video over
FireWire:)

Best regards,
Yuchen

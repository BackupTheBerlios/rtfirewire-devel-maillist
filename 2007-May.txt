Hi all,

I'm a student of the university  of Twente. I am working on a short assignment which partly consists of porting the rtfirewire software to RTAI using RTDM. 

I have a test setup consisting of two pc's with linux kernel 2.6.15.7
, RTAI 3.4 and Xenomai 2.1.3

I followed the instructions in the documentation folder, but couldn't configure RTfirewire under Xenomai 2.1.3. The configuration stucks on the --config argument. I think this is caused by the fact that for this xenomai version, no configuration menu is present. I tryed to change the auto configuration file, but I cannot open it. The next error occured: cannot open config/m4/libtool.m4 there is no such file or directory. I also couldn't configure RTAI 3.4, but after some modifications to the normal config file, I managed to get it working. For Xenomai however, this is a lot of work. How can I get this working? (otherwise I will use xenomai 2.0)

Another question is, how does primitives.h know which RTAI or Xenomai version is defined? I couldn't find it.

FOr my assignment I also want to perform some latency tests to see if there is any latency difference between RTAI and Xenomai. I read in another post, that another tool than rtping is used to test the latency for isochronous transaction. I would like to use that tool in order to have a clear reference wit the test results shown in the Msc report. 

Thanks in advance..

Greetings,

No need for this. RTFirewire is configured just like RTnet, except that
it just comes with plain configure. You need to pass
--with-linux=<path-to-xenomai-kernel>
--with-rtext-config=<path-to-xeno-config> for modern Xenomai versions.

Please, you or Yuchen: get rid of most of these primitives! We have RTDM
as clear abstraction (minus RTAI legacy stuff like rtos_timer_start --
but those are only _2_ functions). Use RTDM_API_VER to detect changes in
that API. Additionally, you can check for CONFIG_XENO_21x or
CONFIG_RTAI_3x to detect in what world you live. See RTnet
(stack/include/rtnet_sys*.h) for how tiny this abstraction can look like
today.

Please pick recent versions for this! Don't benchmark Xenomai 2.0 e.g.,
that's pointless for new projects. Also use a recent kernel, not 2.6.15.
The same applies to RTAI as well (older versions than 3.5 are broken
/wrt RTDM or unsupported anyway).

Can't help with the tool, but maybe with something else:

I've hacked (it is _really_ a quick-hack!) support for building
rtfirewire trunk against Xenomai trunk (RTDM rev. 6) and 2.6.20, see
attachment (it's huge and packed due to generated automake changes).
There were quite a few API violation popping up (namely around
rtdm_lock_t vs. spinlock_t), and there are still warnings. So, be warned
;), it may break.

For comprehensive testing, I can recommend latest I-pipe patches
(2.6.20-i386-1.8-04) with full debug options (CONFIG_IPIPE_DEBUG_CONTEXT
+ CONFIG_XENO_OPT_DEBUG_RTDM). This can help reveal broken pieces in the
stack due to refactoring (or even older problems).

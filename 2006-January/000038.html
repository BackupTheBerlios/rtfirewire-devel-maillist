<PRE>Hi Jan,

Just back from vacation:), now time to go back to work.
Best wishes before we kick out for 2006!!

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;Ok, now time for real debating:)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;Let's first sketch the main frame code to support this service.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;struct Cap_struct {
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;         struct net_dev *fakedev;  /*the fake ethernet dev to deliver
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;captured packet to user-space*/
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;         struct rt-buffer-pool   *cap_pool;  /*where the buffers to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;compensate application memory come from*/
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;        int buffer_size;  /* the size of buffer that can be captured here */
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;}
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;So, that structure describes a capturing instance, conceptually
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;something like rtcap service of RTnet?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Here the difference is, compared with rtcap in RTnet, every single
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Capturer has its own buffer pool and interface-to-userspace (the fake
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ethernet). The latter can be seen the same in RTnet, as you have tap
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dev for each rtdev.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, sounds interesting. But I guess this does not yet mean that there
</I>&gt;<i> can be multiple capturers for the same packet? I guess it means that you
</I>&gt;<i> decide later during the stack traversal (or earlier when looking at the
</I>&gt;<i> transmission path) if you want to grab a certain packet or not. Some
</I>&gt;<i> kind of in-kernel capturing filter instead of doing this later with
</I>&gt;<i> Ethereal&amp;friends?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Whether multiple capturers is supported or not depends on how many
pointers to compensation buffer are there in the rt_buffer struct.
Now, we have only one pointer so only one capturer is supported at one
time, but if we have two, then two capturer are supported at one time,
and so on. ONLY when all the compensation buffer are released, i.e.
all the pointers are null, the original buffer can be released. This
is checked everytime the free_rtbuffer is called.

&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But all in all, the new Capturing is oriented to application instead
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of network interface:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when rtcap module in RTnet is loaded, it changes the xmit_hook&amp;rx_hook
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of a certain rtdev  with informing the applications, i.e. the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; capturing service is fully transparent to applications. (Fix me, if I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; am wrong:)) The new Capturing is new mainly because it lets
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; applications take over the control of capturing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mmh, doesn't this confuse the user and make the management of all those
</I>&gt;<i> potential capturing sources a bit complicated? I already had problems to
</I>&gt;<i> explain users why there is also a &quot;rteth0-mac&quot; that additionally records
</I>&gt;<i> the queuing date of packets deferred by a RTmac discipline. Actually, I
</I>&gt;<i> haven't stumbled over a useful use case for this feature on my own so far...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>What I know is it will allow user to decide if they want to capture
the packets (i.e. recording the data flow) in their application.
Again, this is NOT only useful in our network case, but quite general
for any application that employes memory for data exchange,
e.g.between user and kernel space.

&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;struct rt-buffer{
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;          .....
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;          struct Cap_struct *aCap;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;}
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;And this link is needed as there can be multiple capturers, right? But
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;what about the additional fields required by rtcap to save the initial
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;buffer layout, the compensation buffer, timestamp, and other stuff? Note
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;that rtcap does deferred capturing. Does your service in RT-FireWire
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;work the same way?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My idea was also deferred capturing, but somehow it was not clearly expressed:)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And yes, the timestamp will be in rt-buffer struct also. For
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; compensation buffer, my initial idea was to only capture the rt-buffer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when it is being freed. In that case, we dont need the compesation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; buffer pointer in rt-buffer struct, since the compensation buffer will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be immediately given to the application buffer pool, i.e. buffer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; exchange between application and capturer. That's also why the
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think to remember having created such a variant in the early rtcap
</I>&gt;<i> days. It works well beside one &quot;minor&quot; ugliness: the queuing order in
</I>&gt;<i> the rtcap pseudo device became chaotic due to deferred buffer release of
</I>&gt;<i> certain NICs and other effects. This means that you will also see a
</I>&gt;<i> non-chronological list in Ethereal! Ok, one may try to reorder the
</I>&gt;<i> packets in rtcap before forwarding it, but this adds further complexity
</I>&gt;<i> and delay (you first have to collect for a while, then reorder, and
</I>&gt;<i> finally forward the packets).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes, this becomes also my concern. But can we rely on the application
to re-order the captured packets? When the user is developing an
application where memory usage (packets) should be captured, he/she
should also develop the software behind the capturer, like in the
Ethereal side, where the captured packets can be re-ordered. The
re-ordering therefore can be depending on the application-specific
protocol. This is mainly used in case of packet fragmentation, right?

&gt;<i> &gt; cap_rtbuffer function should return the pointer to compensation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; buffer. BUT now, I would rather choose to let application decide when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to capture the packet: stamping the time, assigning the compensation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; packet and putting into the queue of captured packet. That is more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; similiar to rtcap in RTnet.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So the rt-buffer struct will be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; struct rt-buffer{
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        ..........
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        struct Cap_struct *aCap;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        struct rt-buffer *comp_buf;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; }
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;/*function to create a Cap_struct*/
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;struct Cap_struct *create_cap( int size, //  the buffer size
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;                                             struct kernel_slab_pool
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;*parent_pool,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;                                              char *name) // the name
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;of fake ethernet dev, should be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;//specific about application
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;{
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;       if(*name already exists){
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;               return (address of existing Cap_struct)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;       }
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;      .............
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;}
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;/*function to remove a Cap_struct*/
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;void remove_cap(struct Cap_struct *aCap_struct)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;Ok, this makes sense.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;/*function to capture a buffer*/
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;struct rt-buffer *cap_rtbuffer(struct rt-buffer *abuffer, int
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;buffer_size, struct cap_struct *aCap)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;{
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;     if(aCap-&gt;buffer_size != buffer_size)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;                   //print error msg and return
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;     else{
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;          //allocate a compesating buffer from the cap pool
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;          // exchange buffers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;          //deliver the captured buffer to fake ethernet dev
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;I hope you do NOT deliver immediately, just pend the delivery for Linux
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;to get in the CPU again.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I thought this would not be real-time killing, since the main work is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; done in the signal handler invoked via netif_rx, but I just realized
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it also should include one time dynamic memory allocation, so now it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will be wrapped in a Linux signal handler. Again like in RTnet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yep, this is fine if it's just that non-RT signal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [mail #2]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sorry, I sent the last mail by mistake, it has not been finished. So
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the story continues here:)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The changed cap_rtbuffer is like:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   void cap_rtbuffer(struct rt-buffer *abuffer, int
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   buffer_size, struct cap_struct *aCap)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  {
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;           if(aCap-&gt;buffer_size != buffer_size)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                    //print error msg and return
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;           else{
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                    //allocate a compensating buffer from the cap pool
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                   if(failed)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                         //out of memory failure and return
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                   //assign comp buffer to abuffer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                  // stamp the time
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                  //put the buffer to the queue as captured packet
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;          }
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; }
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In terms of rtcap: would cat_rtbuffer be something like
</I>&gt;<i> rtcap_report_incoming and would it be called from the xmit-hook for
</I>&gt;<i> outgoing packets?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>In principle, the cap_rtbuffer can be called anywhere, with a
rt-buffer and a Capturer (cap_struct). If the user want to capture all
the packets that his application is sending, he can insert the
cap_rtbuffer to the xmit path, which is quite different than in RTnet.

&gt;<i> But we will certainly still have something like rtcap_mark_incoming to
</I>&gt;<i> save the real packet dimension, don't we?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>(Em,my brain gets stuck here:)) Why the rtcap_mark_incoming is
necessary? What I know is, the Linux signal handler will dequeue a
captured packet, allocate a piece of memory (skb) which is of the
length rt-buffer-&gt;len,  and copy the content of the captured pakcet to
the allocated skb, and deliver the skb and free the captured packet.
In this process, I dont see the place where rtcap_mark_incoming should
be used. Or do I miss sth?

&gt;<i> &gt; [...]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Em...I would like to know more about this: how to move the capturing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mark in RTnet from where it is now? Now, I see it only happens when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; packets is transmitted or received.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, the decision about capturing a packet or not is made for incoming
</I>&gt;<i> packets via rtmac_report_incoming. For outgoing ones, we have the hook
</I>&gt;<i> before the drivers transmission routing, a low intrusive approach
</I>&gt;<i> regarding code modification. To move to incoming capturing point would
</I>&gt;<i> be simple, but we would need a similar functions then also for outgoing
</I>&gt;<i> packets to gain more flexibility.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Could you point me to the implementation of rtmac_report_incoming in
the cross reference. Strange that I cant find it.

&gt;<i> But this just raises the question for we what subsystems / packet
</I>&gt;<i> producer you want to instrument separately in this way? And how will the
</I>&gt;<i> user select the right one? Will there be bulks of pseudo network devices
</I>&gt;<i> for capturing?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [...]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I just created a new branch in RTFW svn. Now only copied the files
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from RTFW's rtpkbuff module, but can be compiled separately. A
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; starting point.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's a good step forward! Actually, I think we should keep all this
</I>&gt;<i> capturing discussion in min, but first start off with the &quot;real&quot; work.
</I>&gt;<i> RTnet's rtskbs and RT-FireWire's rtpks also began without capturing, so
</I>&gt;<i> we should also be able to easily extend the first common (and maybe
</I>&gt;<i> working) concept with this feature later.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>You are right. To make the common buffer module work is of first
priority. Besides, I will try to make RT-FW work with Xenomai 2.1
asap.

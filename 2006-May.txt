Subject: [Rtfirewire-devel] RTfirewire porting to RTAI
Message-ID: <1148463018.447427aaa9c54@webmail.utwente.nl>

Dear all,

I am a student of the university of Twente (Embedded system design), and my 
Pre-doctoral assignment is porting the RTfirewire software from xenomai to 
RTAI that Yuchen Zhang wrote. This is because all the projects at our 
department use the RTAI module.

When I have questions about the source code would you want to answer them? And 
do I have to send them by email?

Thanks in advance.

Greetings,

Harm de Boer

Hi,

sure, I am willing to answer any questions concerning RT-FireWire.
Unfortunately the work has been kind of stopped in the last few
months, due to the fact that I am fully occupied by my official job.
But I have the basic setup at home to try out the code, so again, in
case you have any questions, proposals, or criticisms, dont hesitate
to speak out in the list, or send mail to me personally.

Good luck,
Yuchen

Some recommendation regarding this port from my POV: the port should
definitely be RTDM-based!

Either you are almost done in case you use 3.3 (better: magma to include
all RTDM fixes), or you should weighing porting back the RTDM support to
your older RTAI version (this would surely be welcome by users of other
RTDM-based drivers) vs. upgrading your OS.

Again, avoid hacking RTAI-specific calls directly into RT-Firewire, it
would generate unmaintainable code. See also RTnet how to handle the
RT-extension differences in a centralised way.

Subject: [Rtfirewire-devel] porting rtfirewire from xenomai to rtai
Message-ID: <1148914481.447b0b317b463@webmail.utwente.nl>

Hello,

As I mailed you earlier, I am currently working on the assingment to port your 
RTfirewire code from Xenomai to RTAI. This is a practical assignment I am 
doing for the embedded system design group at the Twente University.

Now I have been browsing through the code to get some feeling for what's in it 
and its structure. I noticed that I need to focus mainly on the modules 
rt_serv and rtpkbuff. These seem to be the only ones that provide 'services' 
to the other modules and use the 'rtos' procedures which are RT platform 
specific. Is this correct?

I also noticed that there is a nice 'translation header-file' 
(rtos_primitives.h) which transforms the RT platform specific calls to a more 
generic call-type which is used by the code. As a starting point for the 
porting, I wanted to compare the Xenomai translation to the RTAI API and 
change where needed.

The thing that puzzles me a bit is that in the rtos_primitives.h it seems as 
if there is already a RTAI translation made (the conditional compiler code #if 
defined(CONFIG_RTAI_24) etc). Is it so that the translation to RTAI is already 
accounted for? Or has it been prepared but never verified? 


Thanks in advance for your reply,

Best regards, Harm

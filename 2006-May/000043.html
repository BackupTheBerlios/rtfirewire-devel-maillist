<PRE>Hello,

As I mailed you earlier, I am currently working on the assingment to port your 
RTfirewire code from Xenomai to RTAI. This is a practical assignment I am 
doing for the embedded system design group at the Twente University.

Now I have been browsing through the code to get some feeling for what's in it 
and its structure. I noticed that I need to focus mainly on the modules 
rt_serv and rtpkbuff. These seem to be the only ones that provide 'services' 
to the other modules and use the 'rtos' procedures which are RT platform 
specific. Is this correct?

I also noticed that there is a nice 'translation header-file' 
(rtos_primitives.h) which transforms the RT platform specific calls to a more 
generic call-type which is used by the code. As a starting point for the 
porting, I wanted to compare the Xenomai translation to the RTAI API and 
change where needed.

The thing that puzzles me a bit is that in the rtos_primitives.h it seems as 
if there is already a RTAI translation made (the conditional compiler code #if 
defined(CONFIG_RTAI_24) etc). Is it so that the translation to RTAI is already 
accounted for? Or has it been prepared but never verified? 


Thanks in advance for your reply,

Best regards, Harm

Hi all,

I'm a student of the university  of Twente. I am working on a short assignment which partly consists of porting the rtfirewire software to RTAI using RTDM. 

I have a test setup consisting of two pc's with linux kernel 2.6.15.7
, RTAI 3.4 and Xenomai 2.1.3

I followed the instructions in the documentation folder, but couldn't configure RTfirewire under Xenomai 2.1.3. The configuration stucks on the --config argument. I think this is caused by the fact that for this xenomai version, no configuration menu is present. I tryed to change the auto configuration file, but I cannot open it. The next error occured: cannot open config/m4/libtool.m4 there is no such file or directory. I also couldn't configure RTAI 3.4, but after some modifications to the normal config file, I managed to get it working. For Xenomai however, this is a lot of work. How can I get this working? (otherwise I will use xenomai 2.0)

Another question is, how does primitives.h know which RTAI or Xenomai version is defined? I couldn't find it.

FOr my assignment I also want to perform some latency tests to see if there is any latency difference between RTAI and Xenomai. I read in another post, that another tool than rtping is used to test the latency for isochronous transaction. I would like to use that tool in order to have a clear reference wit the test results shown in the Msc report. 

Thanks in advance..

Greetings,

</PRE>

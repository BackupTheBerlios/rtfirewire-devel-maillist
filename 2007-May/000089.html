<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> Hi all,

</I>&gt;<i> For Xenomai however, this is a lot of work. How can I get this

</I>
No need for this. RTFirewire is configured just like RTnet, except that
it just comes with plain configure. You need to pass
--with-linux=&lt;path-to-xenomai-kernel&gt;
--with-rtext-config=&lt;path-to-xeno-config&gt; for modern Xenomai versions.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another question is, how does primitives.h know which RTAI or Xenomai
</I>&gt;<i> version is defined? I couldn't find it.
</I>
Please, you or Yuchen: get rid of most of these primitives! We have RTDM
as clear abstraction (minus RTAI legacy stuff like rtos_timer_start --
but those are only _2_ functions). Use RTDM_API_VER to detect changes in
that API. Additionally, you can check for CONFIG_XENO_21x or
CONFIG_RTAI_3x to detect in what world you live. See RTnet
(stack/include/rtnet_sys*.h) for how tiny this abstraction can look like
today.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> FOr my assignment I also want to perform some latency tests to see if
</I>&gt;<i> there is any latency difference between RTAI and Xenomai. I read in
</I>
Please pick recent versions for this! Don't benchmark Xenomai 2.0 e.g.,
that's pointless for new projects. Also use a recent kernel, not 2.6.15.
The same applies to RTAI as well (older versions than 3.5 are broken
/wrt RTDM or unsupported anyway).

&gt;<i> another post, that another tool than rtping is used to test the
</I>&gt;<i> latency for isochronous transaction. I would like to use that tool in
</I>&gt;<i> order to have a clear reference wit the test results shown in the Msc
</I>&gt;<i> report.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Can't help with the tool, but maybe with something else:

I've hacked (it is _really_ a quick-hack!) support for building
rtfirewire trunk against Xenomai trunk (RTDM rev. 6) and 2.6.20, see
attachment (it's huge and packed due to generated automake changes).
There were quite a few API violation popping up (namely around
rtdm_lock_t vs. spinlock_t), and there are still warnings. So, be warned
;), it may break.

For comprehensive testing, I can recommend latest I-pipe patches
(2.6.20-i386-1.8-04) with full debug options (CONFIG_IPIPE_DEBUG_CONTEXT
+ CONFIG_XENO_OPT_DEBUG_RTDM). This can help reveal broken pieces in the
stack due to refactoring (or even older problems).

<PRE>Hi,
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm a student of the university  of Twente. I am working on a short assignment which partly consists of porting the rtfirewire software to RTAI using RTDM.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have a test setup consisting of two pc's with linux kernel 2.6.15.7
</I>&gt;<i> , RTAI 3.4 and Xenomai 2.1.3
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I followed the instructions in the documentation folder, but couldn't configure RTfirewire under Xenomai 2.1.3. The configuration stucks on the --config argument. I think this is caused by the fact that for this xenomai version, no configuration menu is present. I tryed to change the auto configuration file, but I cannot open it. The next error occured: cannot open config/m4/libtool.m4 there is no such file or directory. I also couldn't configure RTAI 3.4, but after some modifications to the normal config file, I managed to get it working. For Xenomai however, this is a lot of work. How can I get this working? (otherwise I will use xenomai 2.0)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I just tried again the trunk version on sourceforge, it compiles with
xenomai-2.1 and Linux 2.6.14. Also rtping works well. Be aware that
you need to specify the path to your real-time linux with
--with-linux, and the path to your xenomai's configure tool with
--with-rtext-config. See the README I just checked in -- in the top
folder not the Documentation folder.

&gt;<i> Another question is, how does primitives.h know which RTAI or Xenomai version is defined? I couldn't find it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>after running the configure tool, the CONFIG_RTAI_30 or others will be
defined. rtos_primitive.h depends on these macros.

&gt;<i> FOr my assignment I also want to perform some latency tests to see if there is any latency difference between RTAI and Xenomai. I read in another post, that another tool than rtping is used to test the latency for isochronous transaction. I would like to use that tool in order to have a clear reference wit the test results shown in the Msc report.
</I>
I didnt make a specific tool for the isochronous testing -- maybe i
expressed my wish to make such a tool. I did some workaround to make
isochronous transaction happen and measured the data arrival interval.

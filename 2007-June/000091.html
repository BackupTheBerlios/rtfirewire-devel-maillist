<PRE>I followed youre instructions about the configuring, but now I get stuck at the RTDM skin. (see console output below)

checking for RT-extension... /usr/src/linux-2.6.15.7-Xenomai (kernel 2.6.15.7-xenomai2.1.3 + Xenomai)
checking for Xenomai installation dir... /usr/xenomai
checking for Xenomai DESTDIR... none
checking for Xenomai version... 2.1.3
checking for RTDM skin...   configure: error: *** Please enable RTDM skin

For xenomai 2.1 there is no menu config anymore, it is done automatically. 
In the compiled xenomai directory however, RTDM is present in the include directory. 
What am I doing wrong?

Greetings,

Harm

Hi,

&gt;<i> Hi all,

</I>
No need for this. RTFirewire is configured just like RTnet, except that
it just comes with plain configure. You need to pass
--with-linux=&lt;path-to-xenomai-kernel&gt;
--with-rtext-config=&lt;path-to-xeno-config&gt; for modern Xenomai versions.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another question is, how does primitives.h know which RTAI or Xenomai
</I>&gt;<i> version is defined? I couldn't find it.
</I>
Please, you or Yuchen: get rid of most of these primitives! We have RTDM
as clear abstraction (minus RTAI legacy stuff like rtos_timer_start --
but those are only _2_ functions). Use RTDM_API_VER to detect changes in
that API. Additionally, you can check for CONFIG_XENO_21x or
CONFIG_RTAI_3x to detect in what world you live. See RTnet
(stack/include/rtnet_sys*.h) for how tiny this abstraction can look like
today.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> FOr my assignment I also want to perform some latency tests to see if
</I>&gt;<i> there is any latency difference between RTAI and Xenomai. I read in
</I>
Please pick recent versions for this! Don't benchmark Xenomai 2.0 e.g.,
that's pointless for new projects. Also use a recent kernel, not 2.6.15.
The same applies to RTAI as well (older versions than 3.5 are broken
/wrt RTDM or unsupported anyway).

&gt;<i> another post, that another tool than rtping is used to test the
</I>&gt;<i> latency for isochronous transaction. I would like to use that tool in
</I>&gt;<i> order to have a clear reference wit the test results shown in the Msc
</I>&gt;<i> report.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Can't help with the tool, but maybe with something else:

I've hacked (it is _really_ a quick-hack!) support for building
rtfirewire trunk against Xenomai trunk (RTDM rev. 6) and 2.6.20, see
attachment (it's huge and packed due to generated automake changes).
There were quite a few API violation popping up (namely around
rtdm_lock_t vs. spinlock_t), and there are still warnings. So, be warned
;), it may break.

For comprehensive testing, I can recommend latest I-pipe patches
(2.6.20-i386-1.8-04) with full debug options (CONFIG_IPIPE_DEBUG_CONTEXT
+ CONFIG_XENO_OPT_DEBUG_RTDM). This can help reveal broken pieces in the
stack due to refactoring (or even older problems).

Jan

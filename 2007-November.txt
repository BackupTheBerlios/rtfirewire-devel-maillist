Hi Jan,

Just applied your patch. Now at least the code compiles with Linux
2.6.23 and Xenomai2.4-rc5.

I didnt try yet with Linux 2.4 for compilation. Also the code is not tested.

sri_embedded(sorry that I didnt find your real name), can you please
check out the trunk version: svn co
https://rtfirewire.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/rtfirewire rtfirewire.
Then try to compile with linux 2.4?

Thanks!

Yuchen

Hi Yuchen,

here is the set of patches (read: hacks) I promised. While packaging it,
I had another idea what may have caused the endless loop of the rt_serv
and changed the code a bit. It's not tested, so may still break.

In any case, refactoring of the code to overcome the rtos_primitives
wrapping, would make things easier maintainable IMHO.
